## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system. A version control system (or source code management 
system) is a tool for storing the source files of a project, distributing them to developers working 
on the project, and coordinating changes made during development. A version control system stores 
not just the current state of the project, but all past states as well. This makes it an important 
tool both for collaboration and for historical investigation. (Often finding when a bug was introduced 
makes it much easier to diagnose and fix it.)

A distributed version control system does all this without requiring a central master server. Instead, 
each copy of the project contains the full change history and copies can be synchronized with each 
other to share updates.

Git is one of several available distributed version control systems; it was originally developed by 
Linus Torvalds for development of the Linux kernel. For information on how to use git, see 
[A step-by-step guide to Git](https://opensource.com/article/18/1/step-step-guide-git).
